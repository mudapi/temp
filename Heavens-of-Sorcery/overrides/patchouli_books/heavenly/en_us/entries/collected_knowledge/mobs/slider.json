As such it cannot be damaged by conventional means, and you must utilize a $(item)Pickaxe$() to chip away at its health. While fighting, the $(thing)Slider$() will move in simple straight lines in an attempt to crush you. Once it takes a large amount of damage, its eye will turn red and it move much faster."
