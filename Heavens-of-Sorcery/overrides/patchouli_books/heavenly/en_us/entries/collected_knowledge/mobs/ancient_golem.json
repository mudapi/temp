Though their numbers are limited in each section of the workshop, we made the fatal mistake of teaching these combative golems how to build more of their kind. The heated blasts of $(thing)Activated Ember$() they shoot can be particularly painful, so some sort of $(thing)Fire Resistance$() may be useful."
