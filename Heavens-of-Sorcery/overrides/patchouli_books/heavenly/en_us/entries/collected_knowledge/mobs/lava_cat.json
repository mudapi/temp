Their body consists entirely of $(item)Lava$(), allowing them to take less damage from magical sources. They will turn into $(thing)Obsidian Cats$() if they come into contact with $(item)Water$(). $(thing)Obsidian Cats$() move slower, deal more damage, and receive reduced physical damage. Both forms can be $(thing)Tamed$() using $(item)Blaze Rods$() and bred using $(item)Blaze Powder$()."
