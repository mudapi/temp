It can measure distances in $(l:useful_things/building_tools/bits)Bits$(), or in whole blocks, either as a direct line, or as the dimensions of the area selected. To change modes, hold $(k:mod.chiselsandbits.other.mode). To select the area to measure, hold Right-Click from start to end point. The distance will be displayed as floating numbers, halfway along the distance measured."
